The field of cryptanalysis is concerned with the study of ciphers, having as its objective the
identification of weaknesses within a cryptographic system that may be exploited to convert
encrypted data (cipher-text) into unencrypted data (plain-text). Whether using symmetric or
asymmetric techniques, cryptanalysis assumes no knowledge of the correct cryptographic key
or even the cryptographic algorithm being used.
